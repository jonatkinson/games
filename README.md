Some games which I'm writing, when I can. See [this post](https://www.jonatkinson.co.uk/posts/game-a-week-1/) for more information.

## pong/pong.py

This is almost a non-game. Bounce the ball off the paddle until the game moves too fast, and your score resets. I once managaed 21 points (sheer luck). This demonstrates:

- `pygame` initialisation
- `pygame.font` usage.
- `pygame.time.clock` for 60fps.

## snake/snake.py

This is a reimplementation of Snake. I spent more time on this, and it shows in the final product.

- 5 increasingly difficult levels.
- Sound!

## tetris/tetris.py

A Tetris clone, probably the minimum viable implementation of Tetris features, while still recognisably being the same game.

## Thanks

- Jason Kottke for the Silkscreen font, which I used throughout.
